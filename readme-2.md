## 🌟 Overview

"Echoes of Yesterday" follows Milo, who awakens in a surreal garden representing their mind. To move forward, they must revisit and resolve key memories scattered across symbolic "memory realms." The game is poetic, slow-paced, emotional, interactive, and deeply immersive.

## 🧩 Main Narrative Arc

### Opening
Milo awakens in a dreamlike garden filled with wilting flowers and half-formed paths. Memories flutter like torn pages in the wind. A mysterious crow named Nyx appears, explaining that Milo's mind has fractured following a traumatic event. The garden represents Milo's consciousness, and to heal, they must journey through five memory realms to confront what they've suppressed.

### Mid-game Revelations
As Milo progresses through each realm, they discover that a car accident six months ago caused them to lose someone dear. Each memory realm reveals another piece of the story—who was lost, Milo's responsibility in the accident, and the aftermath. The "Echoes" are fragments of people from Milo's past, preserved in memory but incomplete.

### Endgame Climax
Milo discovers that they've been in a coma since the accident, and this mindscape is their consciousness processing grief and trauma before either waking up or letting go. The final realm forces Milo to confront the full truth of what happened, with the player's previous choices determining which paths remain open.

### Why Memories Are Fractured
Milo's mind fractured the memories as a defense mechanism against overwhelming guilt and grief. By compartmentalizing the emotions and people involved, Milo avoided confronting the full weight of the trauma at once.

### Title Connection
"Echoes of Yesterday" refers to how memories reverberate through time, changing shape with each recollection. The "Echoes" (NPCs) are reverberations of people once known, preserved but distorted through the lens of memory and emotion. Like actual echoes, they are reflections that gradually fade unless acknowledged.

### Choice & Memory System
Throughout the game, players make choices in how to interact with memories:
- **Confront**: Face the memory directly, gaining painful insight but healing the garden
- **Reinterpret**: Change perspective on the memory, altering its emotional impact
- **Suppress**: Avoid confronting the memory, which temporarily eases pain but causes garden deterioration

A "Memory Resonance" meter tracks how honestly Milo has dealt with their past. This affects which Echoes remain by the end and which paths become available.

### The Three Endings

1. **Acceptance** (Memory Resonance >75%): Milo awakens from their coma, having processed their grief. Though scarred, they rejoin the world with a new appreciation for life and memory. The garden blooms fully, and the Echoes release Milo with loving farewells.

2. **Denial** (Memory Resonance <25%): Milo retreats further into their mind, rejecting reality. The garden becomes an increasingly glitched paradise as Milo's mind deteriorates. Medically, they remain in a persistent vegetative state as their consciousness lives in a fabricated reality.

3. **Rewrite** (Memory Resonance 25-75%): Milo creates a new internal narrative—neither fully accepting nor denying the past. They awaken but carry their altered memories, living in a personal mythology that lets them function but never fully heal. The garden stabilizes but never fully blooms or dies.

## 👤 Characters

### Milo (The Protagonist)

**Appearance**: Mid-20s, with a deliberately ambiguous presentation allowing players to project themselves. Wears a faded blue hoodie with a subtle light motif embroidered on the sleeve. Hair color shifts slightly based on the emotional state of each realm. Eyes reflect the current memory realm's dominant color.

**Personality**: Introspective, creative, and kind but prone to self-blame and avoidance. Before the accident, Milo was an aspiring composer who found meaning in translating emotions to music.

**Emotional State**: Initially confused and numb, Milo gradually experiences the full spectrum of grief as memories return—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and potentially acceptance.

**Inner Journey**: From emotional fragmentation to potential wholeness. Milo must learn that memories, even painful ones, are part of identity—and that forgetting the past means losing pieces of oneself.

### Nyx (The Crow Companion)

**Role**: A guide who speaks in riddles and metaphors. Nyx represents Milo's subconscious intuition and the part of them that knows they must face their memories to heal.

**Appearance**: A sleek, iridescent crow whose feathers shift subtly between deep blue and violet. Eyes glow with gentle white light when delivering important insights.

**Hidden Motivations**: Nyx is actually a manifestation of Milo's creativity—the musical spirit that helped them process emotions before the accident. If players discover this through optional dialogue paths, Nyx reveals additional memories of Milo's music and its connection to healing.

**Side Arc**: Players can collect scattered musical notes throughout realms to restore Milo's forgotten compositions, unlocking Nyx's backstory and abilities to temporarily transform the environment through music.

### The Five Echoes (Memory Realm NPCs)

#### 1. Echo: Eliza (Parent)

**Backstory**: Milo's mother, who raised them alone after their father left. She encouraged Milo's musical talent but worried about its financial viability.

**Relation to Milo**: Parent who sacrificed everything for Milo's wellbeing and dreams.

**Trauma/Lesson**: Represents unresolved guilt about not appreciating her sacrifices and arguments about Milo's career choices before her death years ago.

**Personality**: Warm but pragmatic, speaks with gentle directness.

**Appearance**: Middle-aged woman with silver-streaked hair tied back, wearing a practical cardigan with colorful embroidered flowers. Her form is most solid of all Echoes, as these memories are older and more processed.

**Voice**: Soothing alto that occasionally harmonizes with the background music.

**Influence**: Helps Milo understand that grief builds upon previous losses. Depending on choices, either reinforces Milo's self-blame or helps them see the accident in perspective.

#### 2. Echo: Theo (Sibling)

**Backstory**: Milo's younger brother, always living somewhat in Milo's shadow but never resentful. He was visiting Milo when the accident occurred.

**Relation to Milo**: Sibling whose unconditional support Milo took for granted.

**Trauma/Lesson**: Represents survivor's guilt—Theo was injured in the accident but survived.

**Personality**: Lighthearted, uses humor to defuse tension, but hides deeper vulnerability.

**Appearance**: Early 20s, wears a patterned beanie covering part of his face, which is subtly glitched/distorted on one side (representing his injuries). His form occasionally flickers between child and adult versions of himself.

**Voice**: Slightly digitized, as if coming through a phone call.

**Influence**: If Milo confronts this Echo honestly, they learn that Theo is still alive but hasn't visited Milo's hospital bed in weeks, overwhelmed by his own trauma. This revelation can either drive Milo toward waking up or deeper into denial.

#### 3. Echo: Amara (Lover)

**Backstory**: Milo's partner who was in the passenger seat during the accident. They had been arguing about Milo's emotional unavailability just before the crash.

**Relation to Milo**: Romantic partner who saw Milo's true self beneath their defenses.

**Trauma/Lesson**: Represents loss of future possibilities and unresolved relationship tensions.

**Personality**: Passionate, insightful, alternates between tender affection and calling Milo out on their avoidance patterns.

**Appearance**: Partial transparency, wearing a flowing dress with a star pattern. The stars slowly fall from her dress as conversations progress, leaving blank spaces. Her face is always slightly obscured by shifting light.

**Voice**: Clear but distant, with occasional reverb as if speaking across a vast space.

**Influence**: The most emotionally complex Echo. Choices with Amara heavily influence the ending, as Milo must decide whether to accept her loss, cling to an idealized memory of her, or rewrite their final moments together.

#### 4. Echo: Dr. Morgan (Mentor)

**Backstory**: Milo's former music professor who recognized their unique talent for emotional expression through composition.

**Relation to Milo**: Mentor who pushed Milo to confront emotions through art rather than suppressing them.

**Trauma/Lesson**: Represents abandoned potential and fear of emotional vulnerability in art.

**Personality**: Intellectually rigorous but deeply empathetic; speaks in musical metaphors.

**Appearance**: Elderly figure with conductor-like movements, whose form is composed of sheet music that occasionally rearranges itself. Instead of footprints, musical notes appear when they walk.

**Voice**: Resonant baritone that modulates like an instrument being tuned.

**Influence**: Helps Milo reconnect with their musical identity and understand how art processes emotion. Can guide Milo to use creativity as a healing tool or as an escape, depending on player choices.

#### 5. Echo: Jamie (Friend)

**Backstory**: Milo's childhood best friend who was driving the car during the accident. They had reconnected recently after years apart.

**Relation to Milo**: The friend who knew Milo before trauma and ambition complicated their identity.

**Trauma/Lesson**: Represents the core mystery—Jamie's fate is unknown to Milo and forms the central revelation.

**Personality**: Authentic, grounding, speaks uncomfortable truths with compassion.

**Appearance**: Always slightly out of focus, wearing clothes that blend into the environment. Face is never fully visible. Leaves watercolor-like footprints that quickly fade.

**Voice**: Whispered but clear, often finishing Milo's sentences.

**Influence**: The final Echo encountered. Jamie reveals whether they survived the crash (determined by previous choices and memory confrontations). This revelation forces Milo to either accept reality or retreat into a constructed narrative.

## 🌍 Memory Realm Design

### Realm 1: "Childhood Symphony – Joy Distorted"

**Emotion**: Innocence corrupted by retrospection

**Visuals**: A giant music box world with oversized instruments and sheet music forming the landscape. Initially bright primary colors that gradually desaturate as players progress deeper. Toy-like buildings with disproportionate dimensions. Weather transitions from sunshine to gentle rainfall.

**Ambient Sound**: Music box melodies that occasionally skip or play wrong notes. Children's laughter echoing distantly.

**Puzzle Mechanic**: "Harmonic Restoration" – Players must rearrange scattered musical phrases on a giant music sheet to recreate Milo's first composition. Each correct placement reveals a memory of Milo learning music with Echo Eliza.

**Cutscene Intro**: Young Milo sits at a piano while Eliza guides their hands. The scene freezes, cracks like glass, and shatters to reveal the music box landscape.

**Cutscene Outro**: After the final puzzle, the restored composition plays as the realm dissolves into musical notes that flow back to the garden.

**Dialogue Tree Example**:
- Eliza: "Do you remember why you started playing?"
  - "To make you proud." (Increases Memory Resonance, reveals Eliza's sacrifice)
  - "Because I loved creating beauty." (Neutral, reveals Milo's passion)
  - "I don't remember anymore." (Decreases Memory Resonance, Eliza becomes more distant)

**Player Learning**: Discovers Milo's early relationship with music as emotional expression and how Eliza's encouragement shaped their identity. Reveals the depth of Eliza's sacrifice to support Milo's talent.

### Realm 2: "Fractured Campus – Ambition's Shadow"

**Emotion**: Pride tainted by regret

**Visuals**: A university campus where buildings twist impossibly, forming Escher-like architecture. Warm amber and deep mahogany tones. Papers and music scores constantly float through the air. Weather alternates between clear skies and sudden fog banks.

**Ambient Sound**: Layered conversation murmurs, distant lectures, occasional orchestral swells when discoveries are made.

**Puzzle Mechanic**: "Perspective Alignment" – Players must rotate sections of the environment to create paths forward. Each alignment reveals conversations between Milo and Dr. Morgan about artistic integrity versus commercial success.

**Cutscene Intro**: Milo receives an award on stage, but as they look into the audience, all faces blur except Dr. Morgan's disappointed expression.

**Cutscene Outro**: Milo and Dr. Morgan sit at a piano, playing a duet that transforms the twisted campus back to normal proportions before it dissolves into sheet music.

**Dialogue Tree Example**:
- Dr. Morgan: "Why did you abandon the symphony project?"
  - "I was afraid it wasn't good enough." (Increases Memory Resonance, reveals Milo's insecurity)
  - "I found a better opportunity." (Neutral, focuses conversation on practicality)
  - "You expected too much from me." (Decreases Memory Resonance, Dr. Morgan becomes fragmentary)

**Player Learning**: Discovers how Milo began to disconnect from emotional authenticity in their work, choosing safer paths over vulnerable expression. Reveals the beginning of Milo's pattern of avoidance.

### Realm 3: "Suspended Bridge – Trust Severed"

**Emotion**: Betrayal and vulnerability

**Visuals**: A massive suspension bridge spanning a foggy chasm. Parts of the bridge are broken or missing. Color palette of steel blues and misty grays with occasional warm lantern light. Rain falls intermittently, creating puddles that reflect different memories when approached.

**Ambient Sound**: Creaking metal, distant thunder, water droplets forming melodies, occasional phone notification sounds.

**Puzzle Mechanic**: "Trust Tethering" – Players must create connection ropes between fragmented bridge sections, each requiring a choice about how much truth to reveal in flashback conversations with Theo. More honest choices create stronger bridges but trigger more painful memories.

**Cutscene Intro**: Milo and Theo walking across the bridge, laughing, when suddenly the structure begins to collapse beneath them.

**Cutscene Outro**: The completed bridge glows with reconnected light as Theo and Milo embrace before Theo fades into firefly-like lights that guide back to the garden.

**Dialogue Tree Example**:
- Theo: "Why didn't you tell me you were struggling?"
  - "I needed to be strong for you." (Neutral, reveals Milo's protectiveness)
  - "I was ashamed of my failures." (Increases Memory Resonance, opens vulnerable dialogue)
  - "You were dealing with your own problems." (Decreases Memory Resonance, bridge section weakens)

**Player Learning**: Discovers that Milo's relationship with Theo was complicated by Milo's need to appear successful. Reveals that Theo was visiting to reconnect after a long silence when the accident occurred.

### Realm 4: "Starlit Ballroom – Love Interrupted"

**Emotion**: Passion and remorse

**Visuals**: A vast ballroom where the floor and ceiling are made of stars and cosmic phenomena. Rich purples, deep blues, and silver accents dominate. Constellations form and reform into scenes from Milo and Amara's relationship. Weather manifests as meteor showers during emotional moments.

**Ambient Sound**: Waltz music that alternates between major and minor keys, heartbeats synchronizing with the rhythm during intense moments.

**Puzzle Mechanic**: "Celestial Choreography" – Players must help memory-figures of Milo and Amara dance through a sequence of steps that recreate their relationship timeline. Missteps cause painful memories to play, while perfect sequences reveal tender moments.

**Cutscene Intro**: Milo and Amara dancing under stars that begin to fall around them, transforming into the ballroom realm.

**Cutscene Outro**: The completed dance ends with Milo and Amara's final kiss before Amara transforms into a constellation that remains visible from the garden.

**Dialogue Tree Example**:
- Amara: "What were you going to say before the car swerved?"
  - "I was going to tell you I loved you." (Neutral, reveals affection but avoids the argument context)
  - "I was going to admit you were right about me hiding my feelings." (Increases Memory Resonance, acknowledges the argument)
  - "It doesn't matter now." (Decreases Memory Resonance, stars begin to fade)

**Player Learning**: Discovers that Milo and Amara were arguing about emotional communication just before the accident. Reveals whether Amara survived and how that knowledge affects Milo's willingness to wake up.

### Realm 5: "Lighthouse in Mist – Truth Illuminated"

**Emotion**: Revelation and choice

**Visuals**: A lighthouse surrounded by shifting fog where scenes from the accident flash like the sweeping lighthouse beam. Stark blacks and whites with the only color coming from a warm lighthouse glow. The environment reconstructs and deconstructs based on Milo's willingness to see the truth.

**Ambient Sound**: Ocean waves, foghorn calls, glass breaking in reverse when memories reconstruct, heartbeat that intensifies as revelations approach.

**Puzzle Mechanic**: "Memory Assembly" – Players piece together fragmented scenes of the accident from multiple perspectives (Milo, Jamie, Theo, Amara). Each completed scene reveals another crucial detail about what really happened and who survived.

**Cutscene Intro**: Milo stands before the lighthouse door as Jamie's silhouette beckons from the top of the tower.

**Cutscene Outro**: Varies based on player choices throughout the game, showing either Milo ascending the lighthouse (Denial), embracing Jamie at the top (Rewrite), or stepping out of the lighthouse door into blinding light (Acceptance).

**Dialogue Tree Example**:
- Jamie: "Do you remember why the car crashed?"
  - "You were distracted because of our argument." (Neutral, places blame externally)
  - "I grabbed the steering wheel." (Increases Memory Resonance dramatically, reveals Milo's role)
  - "It was just an accident. No one's fault." (Decreases Memory Resonance, fog thickens)

**Player Learning**: Discovers the full truth of the accident—that in the heat of an emotional argument, Milo grabbed the steering wheel from Jamie, causing the crash. Learns who survived and who didn't, with the revelation potentially changing based on how honestly Milo has confronted previous memories.

## 🌀 Memory Garden (Hub World)

### Initial State

## 🎞️ Cutscenes & Transitions

### Opening Cutscene: Awakening

*[Fade in from white]*

A close-up of Milo's eyes opening, reflecting a kaleidoscope of fragmented memories. They sit up in a garden clearing as mist swirls around withered flowers. Their hands pass through objects like they're not fully substantial.

**Milo** *(confused)*: "Where am I? What happened to..."

*[Memory flash: Headlights, screeching tires, shattering glass]*

**Milo** *(clutching head)*: "I can't remember..."

*[A crow lands on the dried fountain, its feathers unnaturally iridescent]*

**Nyx**: "The mind protects itself in fascinating ways, doesn't it? Fragments what it cannot bear to hold together."

**Milo**: "You... you can talk?"

**Nyx**: "I am Nyx. And you are in the garden of your mind, Milo. These paths lead to memories you've locked away. To leave this place, you must walk them."

**Milo**: "Leave to where? What happened to me?"

**Nyx**: "That's what you're here to discover. Each Echo will show you a piece. Whether you truly see it... that's your choice."

*[Camera pans out to reveal five overgrown paths radiating from the garden, each glowing faintly with a different color]*

**Nyx**: "Remember: what is forgotten is not gone. Only hidden. Like seeds beneath winter soil."

*[Nyx flies toward one of the paths, leaving a trail of luminescent feathers]*

### Realm Intro Transitions

**Childhood Symphony Transition**:
*[Whispered Monologue over visuals of the path transforming into sheet music]*

**Milo's Voice**: "First steps, first notes. Mother's hands guiding mine across ivory keys. Joy so pure it needed no words—only melody. Before I understood that music could bleed..."

**Fractured Campus Transition**:
*[Path transforms into academic halls that twist impossibly as pages flutter around Milo]*

**Milo's Voice**: "Technique perfected, emotion controlled. Praise became currency, authenticity its price. Mentor's eyes seeing through the performance to the fear beneath..."

**Suspended Bridge Transition**:
*[Path extends into a fog-shrouded bridge as rain begins to fall]*

**Milo's Voice**: "Brother's voice on the phone. 'I'm coming to see you.' Years of distance bridged by three hours on the highway. If I had known it would be our last..."

**Starlit Ballroom Transition**:
*[Path rises upward, transforming into stairs made of constellations]*

**Milo's Voice**: "Her laugh like a melody I couldn't transcribe. Her touch rewriting my composition. The argument in the car—what were my last words to her? Please, not anger..."

**Lighthouse in Mist Transition**:
*[Path narrows, disappearing into thick fog illuminated by distant light]*

**Milo's Voice**: "Friend from childhood, driver at the wheel. Your face in the rearview mirror, then headlights from nowhere. Impact. Silence. Darkness. What did I do?"

### Realm Outro Cutscenes

**Childhood Symphony Outro**:
Eliza and young Milo complete the musical composition together. As the final note plays, Eliza cups Milo's face.

**Eliza**: "Music was never about perfection. It was about feeling—even the painful notes."

She dissolves into musical notes that flow back toward the garden, forming the first flower. Milo touches it, and it either blooms fully, shifts colors, or crystallizes, depending on player choices.

**Fractured Campus Outro**:
Dr. Morgan stands before a completed musical score with Milo.

**Dr. Morgan**: "You always saw your vulnerability as weakness. But it's the source of your greatest work."

They dissolve into floating pages that reform as another flower in the garden. The campus straightens and normalizes as Milo departs.

**Suspended Bridge Outro**:
Theo and Milo stand on the completed bridge.

**Theo**: "I never blamed you. That's the thing about brothers—we fall together, we rise together."

Theo fades into lights that reform as another garden flower. Depending on choices, we see a hospital scene flash briefly—Theo in a wheelchair beside an unseen bed.

**Starlit Ballroom Outro**:
Amara and Milo complete their dance under the cosmic ceiling.

**Amara**: "Love isn't in the perfect moments. It's in the crashes, the arguments, the apologies."

She transforms into stars that flow back to form another garden flower. As she fades, we hear her whisper either "Wake up" or "Stay with me," depending on player choices.

**Lighthouse in Mist Outro**: 
*(Three variants based on player's path)*

### Final Endings Cutscenes

#### 1. Acceptance Ending: "Awakening"

*[Inside the lighthouse, Milo climbs stairs that transform into hospital corridors]*

Milo enters a room filled with light where all five Echoes stand together. Each steps forward to embrace Milo, then fades away with whispered words of goodbye.

Jamie is revealed last, showing whether they survived (based on previous choices). If alive, they squeeze Milo's hand; if not, they simply smile and nod.

**Jamie**: "It's time to wake up, Milo. The real world won't be as clear as this one. But it's where you belong."

*[White fade to hospital room]*

Milo's eyes open to see Theo in a wheelchair beside the bed. Outside the window, the garden elements are echoed in a real hospital garden where flowers bloom.

**Milo** *(weakly)*: "I remember everything."

**Theo** *(crying)*: "Welcome back."

A crow lands briefly on the windowsill before flying away.

*[Camera follows the crow up to show the city, life continuing]*

#### 2. Denial Ending: "The Beautiful Prison"

*[Inside the lighthouse, stairways multiply impossibly]*

Milo chooses a door that leads back to the garden, now transformed into a vibrant but subtly wrong paradise. Colors too bright, physics slightly off.

All Echoes await, but with glitching appearances. They welcome Milo "home" with too-perfect smiles.

**Nyx** *(sadly, apart from the group)*: "You've chosen your own creation over reality. A perfect prison is still a prison."

*[Brief cut to hospital room]*

Doctors speak over a bed where Milo lies unresponsive, machines beeping steadily.

**Doctor**: "Brain activity is stable, but there's no response to stimuli. Family should consider long-term care options."

*[Cut back to the fantasy garden]*

Milo, oblivious, conducts an orchestra of memory fragments as the garden's edges show digital decay. The music swells as the screen iris-closes on Milo's blissfully unaware expression.

#### 3. Rewrite Ending: "The Middle Path"

*[Inside the lighthouse, Milo faces multiple version of each memory]*

Milo takes pieces from different memory versions, creating a collage of what happened. Jamie appears, their form shifting between alive and gone.

**Jamie**: "Neither truth nor fiction. You're creating a third path."

**Milo**: "One I can live with."

*[Fade to hospital room]*

Milo awakens, but certain details around the room shift subtly—photos on the wall change slightly, cards from visitors rearrange.

**Theo**: "You've been talking in your sleep. About music again."

**Milo**: "I'm going to compose again. About everything that happened."

**Theo** *(confused)*: "You remember it differently than I do."

**Milo**: "Maybe that's okay."

*[Milo looks out the window to see Nyx on a branch, and for a moment, Amara's reflection in the glass—whether she survived or not in reality]*

*[Camera pulls back to show Milo picking up a notebook, beginning to write music again]*

### Character Design Philosophy

**Milo**: Deliberately ambiguous design allowing player projection. Appearance subtly reflects emotional state through posture, color accents, and expression. Hoodie with light motif serves as consistent element.

**Nyx**: Iridescent crow with supernatural elements. Feathers shift colors based on information being delivered. Eyes glow during important revelations.

**Echoes**: Each Echo has a unique visual treatment reflecting their relationship to Milo:
- **Eliza**: Most solid and detailed, with warm-hued aura
- **Theo**: Partially glitched/distorted, flickering between ages
- **Amara**: Semi-transparent with celestial elements, face obscured by light
- **Dr. Morgan**: Form composed of animated musical notation
- **Jamie**: Always slightly out of focus, blending with environments

### Animation Style & Techniques

**Character Movement**:
- Fluid, hand-drawn animation with 12 frames per second for characters
- Environmental animations run at 24 fps for contrast
- Echoes have ethereal, floating movement patterns
- Nyx has quick, decisive movements with feather particles

**Parallax Effects**:
- Each environment has 3-5 depth layers that move independently
- Memory fragments float between layers, creating dimensional effect
- Distance layers blur slightly during emotional moments
- Navigation between realms uses deep parallax transitions

**Particle Systems**:
- Memory particles: Glowing motes that trail characters
- Emotional indicators: Color-coded particle bursts during decisions
- Environmental particles: Realm-specific elements (music notes, paper scraps, raindrops, stardust, fog wisps)
- Transition effects: Dissolving/reforming particles when moving between areas

**Camera Techniques**:
- Smooth tracking during side-scrolling exploration
- Gentle zoom during dialogue sequences
- Dutch angles during emotional distress
- Slow pans during revelations
- Letterboxing transitions into cutscenes

### UI Visual Design

**Minimal Interface**:
- No traditional HUD elements
- Memory Resonance visualized through garden state rather than meters
- Dialogue choices appear as floating thought bubbles
- Puzzle interactions use natural environmental elements rather than obvious UI

**Transition Effects**:
- Realm transitions use ink-wash effects that bleed between scenes
- Memory flashbacks use watercolor bleeds and paper texture
- Emotional shifts trigger subtle color grading changes
- Cutscenes transition with page-turning or dissolve effects

## 🧠 Emotional Game Mechanics

### Memory Flower System

**Core Mechanic**:
Each memory confronted spawns a unique flower in the garden, with properties determined by player choices:

- **Confrontation Flowers**: Vibrant, fully-bloomed flowers with distinct forms. Emit gentle light and occasionally release memory particles when approached. These strengthen over time and contribute most to the Acceptance path.

- **Reinterpretation Flowers**: Watercolor-like blooms that shift hues based on time of day. Their appearance changes subtly each time the player returns to the garden. These stable flowers contribute to the Rewrite path.

- **Suppression Flowers**: Crystal sculptures of flowers, beautiful but fragile. Occasionally crack or glitch when approached. These deteriorate over time and contribute to the Denial path.

**Garden Evolution**:
- Flowers from the same realm grow in clusters, creating emotion-themed garden sections
- Dominant choice patterns cause specific weather patterns in the garden
- Flower combinations unlock special interactions with Nyx and Echoes
- Final garden state determines available endings and closing cutscene

### Mood Shift System

**Environmental Response**:
Player choices create immediate and cumulative environmental changes:

- **Immediate Responses**:
  - Confrontation: Brief weather intensity (rain, wind, light)
  - Reinterpretation: Color saturation shifts and subtle geometry changes
  - Suppression: Brief visual glitches and sound distortion

- **Cumulative Effects**:
  - High Confrontation: Clearer visuals, more dynamic weather, stronger colors
  - High Reinterpretation: Surreal but balanced visuals, perpetual golden hour lighting
  - High Suppression: Increasing visual glitches, unnaturally perfect sections contrasting with degrading elements

**Character Responses**:
- Echoes respond differently based on Milo's dominant mood pattern
- Nyx's guidance changes tone and directness
- Memory figures show alternative reactions in flashbacks

### Emotional Puzzle Design

**Childhood Symphony**:
*Harmonic Restoration* – Players arrange musical phrases to recreate Milo's first composition. Each correctly placed phrase reveals a memory fragment. The emotional challenge is choosing which version of events to restore – the happy childhood moments or the more complex reality of Eliza's sacrifices.

**Fractured Campus**:
*Perspective Alignment* – Players rotate sections of impossible architecture to create paths forward. Each alignment reveals conversations about artistic integrity versus commercial success. The emotional weight comes from choosing which values to prioritize in reconstructing Milo's academic journey.

**Suspended Bridge**:
*Trust Tethering* – Players create connection ropes between fragmented bridge sections. Each rope requires a choice about how much truth to reveal in flashback conversations with Theo. Stronger bridges require more painful admissions.

**Starlit Ballroom**:
*Celestial Choreography* – Players guide memory-figures of Milo and Amara through a dance that recreates their relationship timeline. Perfect sequences reveal tender moments, while missteps trigger painful memories that must be either confronted or reinterpreted.

**Lighthouse in Mist**:
*Memory Assembly* – Players piece together fragmented scenes of the accident from multiple perspectives. The emotional core is deciding which version of events to accept as truth, with direct consequences for the final outcome.

### Memory Resonance Meter

Rather than a traditional visible meter, Memory Resonance is represented through multiple systemic indicators:

**Visual Indicators**:
- Garden state (bloom vs. wither)
- Milo's appearance (posture, color accents)
- Weather patterns and lighting
- Clarity vs. distortion in memories

**Gameplay Effects**:
- High Resonance: More direct Echo communication, clearer navigation, more detailed memories
- Low Resonance: Cryptic Echo dialogue, maze-like paths, fragmented memories

**Threshold Events**:
- Reaching 25%, 50%, and 75% Resonance triggers garden transformations
- Nyx offers different guidance at each threshold
- New areas of the garden become accessible
- Echoes may reveal additional optional memories
